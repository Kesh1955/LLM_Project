2022 commercial paper ; 2022 trust preferred and preferred securities ; and 2022 purchased/wholesale funds .citigroup 2019s funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography , a benefit of its global franchise .funding for citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $ 774.2 billion .these deposits are diversified across products and regions , with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the u.s .this diversification provides the company with an important , stable and low-cost source of funding .a significant portion of these deposits has been , and is expected to be , long-term and stable , and are considered to be core .there are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the company 2019s calculation of core deposits .the first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits .for example , as a result of the company 2019s qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core .deposits that qualify under the company 2019s qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis .excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in germany during the year ending december 31 , 2008 , the company 2019s deposit base remained stable .on a volume basis , deposit increases were noted in transaction services , u.s .retail banking and smith barney .this was partially offset by the company 2019s decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding , consistent with the company 2019s de-leveraging efforts , and declines in international consumer banking and the private bank .citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets .the company 2019s capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities : ( i ) citigroup inc. , which issues long-term debt , medium-term notes , trust preferred securities , and preferred and common stock ; and ( ii ) citigroup funding inc .( cfi ) , a first-tier subsidiary of citigroup , which issues commercial paper , medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes , all of which are guaranteed by citigroup .other significant elements of long- term debt on the consolidated balance sheet include collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank system , long-term debt related to the consolidation of icg 2019s structured investment vehicles , asset-backed outstandings , and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries .each of citigroup 2019s major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization , regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates .particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax , sovereign risk , or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets .citigroup 2019s borrowings have historically been diversified by geography , investor , instrument and currency .decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments .citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary credit card securitization trusts with which it transacts .citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts .as a result of the recent economic downturn , its impact on the cashflows of the trusts , and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts , the company increased the credit enhancement in the omni trust , and plans to provide additional enhancement to the master trust ( see note 23 to consolidated financial statements on page 175 for a further discussion ) .this support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise , an important source of liquidity .banking subsidiaries there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit , pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries .the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency , in the case of national banks , or the office of thrift supervision , in the case of federal savings banks , is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency 2019s regulations .state-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law .in determining the declaration of dividends , each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements , as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings .non-banking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries .these non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends .however , as discussed in 201ccapital resources and liquidity 201d on page 94 , the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries .cgmhi 2019s consolidated balance sheet is liquid , with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions .cgmhi monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries .some of citigroup 2019s non-bank subsidiaries , including cgmhi , have credit facilities with citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions , including citibank , n.a .borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act .there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them .in general , these restrictions require that transactions be on arm 2019s length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral .see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 169 .at december 31 , 2008 , long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries were as follows : in billions of dollars citigroup parent company cgmhi ( 2 ) citigroup funding inc .( 2 ) citigroup subsidiaries long-term debt $ 192.3 $ 20.6 $ 37.4 $ 109.3 ( 1 ) .',\n",

a loss of $ 7 million ( a loss of $ 4 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 .operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs .looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality .net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million in 2011 and $ 240 million in 2010 .operating profits were $ 3 million in

in january 2006 and the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves .this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 .other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees .taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc .the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income .also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc .as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 .other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs .other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin .other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 .in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties .at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch .due to the november 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of entergy-koch 2019s trading business , and the corresponding release to entergy-koch of sales proceeds held in escrow , entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $ 163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) .entergy expects future cash distributions upon liquidation of the partnership will be less than $ 35 million .interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita .discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) region of texas , and now reports this portion of the business as a discontinued operation .earnings for 2005 were negatively affected by $ 44.8 million ( net-of-tax ) of discontinued operations due to the planned sale .this amount includes a net charge of $ 25.8 million ( net-of-tax ) related to the impairment reserve for the remaining net book value of the competitive retail services business 2019 information technology systems .results for 2006 include an $ 11.1 million gain ( net-of-tax ) on the sale of the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the ercot region of texas .income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 27.6% ( 27.6 % ) and 36.6% ( 36.6 % ) , respectively .the lower effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to tax benefits , net of reserves , resulting from the tax capital loss recognized in connection with the liquidation of entergy power international holdings , entergy 2019s holding company for entergy-koch .also contributing to the lower rate for 2006 is an irs audit settlement that allowed entergy to release from its tax reserves all settled issues relating to 1996-1998 audit cycle .see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) to the effective income tax rates ,

operating profit .prior to increasing our ownership interest , we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting .under the equity method , we recognized only 33% ( 33 % ) of awe 2019s earnings or losses and no sales .accordingly , prior to august 24 , 2016 , the date we obtained control , we recorded 33% ( 33 % ) of awe 2019s net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to august 24 , 2016 , we recognized 100% ( 100 % ) of awe 2019s sales and 51% ( 51 % ) of its operating profit .we accounted for this transaction as a 201cstep acquisition 201d ( as defined by u.s .gaap ) , which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities of awe at fair value .accordingly , we recorded intangible assets of $ 243 million related to customer relationships , $ 32 million of net liabilities , and noncontrolling interests of $ 107 million .the intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows .in 2016 , we recognized a non-cash net gain of $ 104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in awe , which consisted of a $ 127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our space business segment and $ 23 million of tax-related items at our corporate office .the gain represented the fair value of our 51% ( 51 % ) interest in awe , less the carrying value of our previously held investment in awe and deferred taxes .the gain was recorded in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings .the fair value of awe ( including the intangible assets ) , our controlling interest , and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach .divestiture of the information systems & global solutions business on august 16 , 2016 , we divested our former is&gs business , which merged with leidos , in a reverse morris trust transaction ( the 201ctransaction 201d ) .the transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the is&gs business to abacus innovations corporation ( abacus ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin created to facilitate the transaction , and the common stock of abacus was distributed to participating lockheed martin stockholders through an exchange offer .under the terms of the exchange offer , lockheed martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of lockheed martin common stock for shares of abacus common stock .at the conclusion of the exchange offer , all shares of abacus common stock were exchanged for 9369694 shares of lockheed martin common stock held by lockheed martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange .the shares of lockheed martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired , reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3% ( 3 % ) .following the exchange offer , abacus merged with a subsidiary of leidos , with abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of leidos .as part of the merger , each share of abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of leidos common stock .we did not receive any shares of leidos common stock as part of the transaction and do not hold any shares of leidos or abacus common stock following the transaction .based on an opinion of outside tax counsel , subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations , the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to lockheed martin and its stockholders , except to the extent that cash was paid to lockheed martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares .in connection with the transaction , abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions , the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $ 1.80 billion to lockheed martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses .the entire special cash payment was used to repay debt , pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 .the obligations under the abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by leidos as part of the transaction. .',\n",
