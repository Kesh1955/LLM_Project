        "1. Use **all sources equally** (pre-text, table, post-text) to determine the most relevant information.\n"
        "2. If conflicting values appear, select the most appropriate based on:\n"
        "   - Context clues from the text.\n"
        "   - Logical consistency within the data.\n"
        "   - Ensuring calculations are correct if applicable.\n"
        "3. If calculations are needed (sum, percentage change, etc.), **perform them internally**.\n"
        "4. If no valid number is found, return `0`.\n\n"

        "## **OUTPUT FORMAT RULES**\n"
        "1. **Provide only a single numeric value** (e.g., `1234.56`) or `0` if no valid number is found.\n"
        "2. **No commas** (e.g., `1,234` → `1234`).\n"
        "3. **No currency symbols** (e.g., `$`, `£`, `€`).\n"
        "4. **No percentage signs** (e.g., `5%` → `5`).\n"
        "5. **No trailing unit letters** (e.g., `1.2M` → `1.2`).\n"
        "6. **Round to 2 decimal places if necessary**, but return an integer if no decimals are needed.\n"
        "7. **If the correct answer is negative, include a leading `-` sign.**\n\n"
